# /main_plots

This folder contains the main plotting scripts for the core simulation results of the project *Randomness Across Layers in Double Machine Learning*.

- **plot_sim1.R**  
  Visualization of the main results from Simulation 1.

- **plot_sim2.R**  
  Visualization of the main results from Simulation 2.

- **plot_sim3.R**  
  Visualizations of the main results from Simulation 3.

All scripts here are designed to produce the key plots shown in the thesis/ based on the simulation outputs.

> **Note:** You will need the corresponding simulation result files from `/results/`and some of the functions from `/functions/`
