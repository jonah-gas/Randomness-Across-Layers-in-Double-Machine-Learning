# Randomness-Across-Layers-in-Double-Machine-Learning

This repository contains all code and results for the Master’s thesis  
**“Randomness Across Layers in Double Machine Learning”**.

## Overview

The project investigates sources of estimator variance in Double Machine Learning (Double ML) using extensive simulation studies.  
All simulations, downstream analyses, and plotting scripts are included and fully reproducible.

### Structure

- **/simulations/**  
  R scripts for running all main simulation studies (Sim1, Sim2, Sim3).

- **/results/**  
  Output files generated by the simulation scripts, separated by DGP and simulation.

- **/main_plots/**  
  Scripts to generate the main figures for the thesis.

- **/functions/**  
  Helper functions for data generation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, etc.

- **/appendix_plots_and_tables/**  
  Scripts for producing additional plots and tables for the appendix.

## Reproducibility

All code is written in R and relies on common packages (see script headers for details).  
Set working directories and file paths as needed.
